# How to RUN

Quick README — run the program with Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed

## Usage
1. Open a terminal in the project root (where `main.py` is located).
2. Run:
```bash
python main.py
```
If your system uses `python3` for Python 3, run:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

There are other codes that you can test. I made those to practice and well understand the openCV library.
That's all.
